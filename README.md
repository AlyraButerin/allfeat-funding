## Introduction:

Allfunding is a crowdfunding solution for artists looking for financing for their project.
Anyone can participate financially in the project by depositing funds into a liquidity pool.
By depositing their funds, the investor receives a proof of contribution by NFT.
The artist submits to a vote the different steps of his project which requests financing, the contributors approve and the artist can use his funds to make the dream he has nourished come true.
